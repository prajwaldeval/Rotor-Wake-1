SHORT introduction (1 page)
A flowchart of your code (1 page)
Main assumptions with an explanation of their impact (max. 1 page)
Plots with explanation of results (alpha/inflow/a/aâ€™/Ct/Cn/Cq vs r/R)
    ##What is Cq????
Spanwise distribution of angle of attack and inflow angle
Spanwise distribution of axial and azimuthal inductions
Spanwise distribution of thrust and azimuthal loading
Total thrust and torque versus tip-speed ratio/advance ratio
For the cases of yawed rotor, also plot the azimuthal variation (suggestion: polar contour plot)
Plots with explanation of the influence of the tip correction
(optional): Plots with explanation of influence of number of annuli, spacing method (constant, cosine) and convergence history for total thrust.
(optional): Explanation of the design approach used for maximizing the Cp or efficiency
(optional): Plots with explanation of the new designs
Plot the distribution of stagnation enthalpy as a function of radius at four locations: infinity upwind, at the rotor (upwind side), at the rotor (downwind side), infinity downwind.
(optional): Plot a representation of the system of circulation. Discuss the generation and release of vorticity in relation to the loading and circulation over the blade.
Discuss the operational point of the airfoil in terms of lift and drag, and the relation between the distribution of lift coefficient and chord (choose one case, not necessary to do all cases)
SHORT discussion/conclusion, highlighting the impact of operational variables and BEM model assumptions on the results
